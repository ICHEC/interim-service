# Structure of the source

This website is created using [Jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html), based on [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).
See the [Jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) for more details. The source for this website uses [MyST Markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).


The structure of the files  looks like follows -


```bash
(web) ðŸ‘½ 618-rajarshi 0 (main)âœ—  tree .
.
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ _config.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ _static
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ style.css
â”œâ”€â”€ _toc.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ contact-us.md
â”œâ”€â”€ index.md
â”œâ”€â”€ interim-service.md

There are three types of files -

1. YAML files, with extension `.yml` which are used to define structure and build process of the pages. `_config.yml` file defines all the configurational options for building the pages, and `_toc.yml` file defines the [table of contents](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/create.html#table-of-contents-toc-yml), and structure of the documents.

2. CSS files, primarily stored in `_static` folder, and define the appearance settings for the webpages.

3. Markdown files, with `.md` extension. These are primarily ones that contain the documentation information. Jupyterbook follows MyST format, which is quite feature rich for building pages and pdfs of the technical documents.
