# National HPC Service

```{tip}
The National HPC Service (NS) is the primary mechanism through which researchers gain access to ICHEC general-purpose computing resources.

These resources are available to all researchers based in Irish third-level institutions, including undergraduate students, PhD students, post-doctoral researchers and other academic staff.

Please note the following - 

```{important}
During the migration of current projects to the Interim Service, between Feb 1 and April 1 2024 no new project applications will be accepted. This to insure the smooth transition to the interim service.
