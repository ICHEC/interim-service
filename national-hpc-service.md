# National HPC Service

```{tip}
The National HPC Service (NS) is the primary mechanism through which researchers gain access to ICHEC general-purpose computing resources.

These resources are available to all researchers based in Irish third-level institutions, including undergraduate students, PhD students, post-doctoral researchers and other academic staff.

Please note the following - 

```{important}
During the migration of current projects to the Interim Service, between Feb 1 and April 1 2024 no new project applications will be accepted. This to insure the smooth transition to the interim service.

# What is this interim-service ?

The `Kay` platform which supported the National HPC Service reached the end of its 5 year service life in November 2023. Because investment for the replacement [CASPIr](https://www.ichec.ie/news/ireland-one-five-sites-selected-eu-host-new-world-class-supercomputer) platform, as part of the [EuroHPC joint undertaking](https://eurohpc-ju.europa.eu/eurohpc-joint-undertaking-announces-five-sites-host-new-world-class-supercomputers-2022-06-15_en), has been delayed and the operational lifespan of Kay could not be further extended for a number of contractual and technical reasons, an interim solution was required to bridge the gap until the CASPIr system can be deployed.
